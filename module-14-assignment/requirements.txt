Assignment 1 (Module 14)

Assignment:
The objective of this assignment is to build a fully functional e-commerce store using Vue.js.
It will create a feature-rich online store that allows users to browse products, add items to the cart, and complete a purchase.

Project Setup:

Set up a new Vue.js project using Vite or your preferred Vue setup.

Create a project structure with components for product listing, product details, shopping cart, user authentication, and checkout.

Product Data:
Define a JSON array of sample product data, including product names, prices, descriptions, image URLs, and other relevant product information.

Product Listing:
Create a product listing page that displays the available products. Use Vue components for each product item.
Implement features such as sorting, filtering, and pagination for the product list.


Product Details:
Create a product details page that displays more information about a selected product when a user clicks on it.
Include an "Add to Cart" button on the product details page to add items to the shopping cart.

Shopping Cart:
Implement a shopping cart component that displays the items added by the user.
Include product names, quantities, prices, and a "Remove" button for each item.
Display the total price of items in the cart and allow users to update quantities or remove items.

User Authentication:
Create a user authentication system. Allow users to register, log in, and log out.
Ensure that only authenticated users can access the checkout process.

Checkout Process:
Create a multi-step checkout process that guides users through providing shipping information and payment details.
Implement form validation and error handling.

Payment Integration (Optional):
Integrate a payment gateway for simulating payment processing (e.g., Stripe, PayPal Sandbox, or a mock payment service).

Data Persistence:
Use local storage or Vuex to persist the cart's data between page refreshes and maintain the user's session.

Optional Enhancements:
Implement user reviews and ratings for products.
Create a dashboard for users to view order history.
Add a product search feature.

Include animations and transitions for a polished user experience.
