Assignment 1 (Module 15)

Assignment (Exploring Inertia.js Fundamentals):

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to explore the fundamental concepts of Inertia.js, its use in server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR), and its integration with backend frameworks like Laravel.


Instructions:
1. Introduction to Inertia.js: Begin by researching and learning more about Inertia.js.
   Read its official documentation and any related resources to gain a deeper understanding of its principles and use cases.
2. Comparison of SSR and CSR: Write a brief essay (approximately 150-200 words) that explains the differences between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) in web applications.
   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
3. Inertia.js Features: List and explain the key features of Inertia.js, including its role in data-driven UI, client-side routing, and shared controllers.
   Provide practical examples to illustrate these features.
4. Integration with Laravel: If possible, set up a basic project using Laravel and Inertia.js to create a simple web application.
   Create at least one page with Inertia.js, and explain how Inertia.js is used within the Laravel framework.
5. Client-Side Components: Discuss the usage of a frontend framework Vue.js alongside Inertia.js to create client-side components.
   Explain how data is exchanged between the server and client.

Note: For learners unfamiliar with PHP, it is not necessary to implement the Laravel and Inertia.js project (step 4) if they have no prior experience with PHP.
      Instead, they can focus on the theoretical understanding of Inertia.js and its concepts.


Submission:
