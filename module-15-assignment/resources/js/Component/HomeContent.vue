        Assignment 1 (Module 15)
        <br>
        Assignment (Exploring Inertia.js Fundamentals):
        <br>
        <br>
        Objective: The objective of this assignment is to explore the fundamental concepts of Inertia.js, its use in
        server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR), and its integration with backend frameworks like
        Laravel.
        <br>
        <br>
        Instructions:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Introduction to Inertia.js: Begin by researching and learning more about Inertia.js. Read its official
        documentation and any related resources to gain a deeper understanding of its principles and use cases.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Comparison of SSR and CSR: Write a brief essay (approximately 150-200 words) that explains the differences
        between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) in web applications. Discuss the advantages
        and disadvantages of each approach.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Inertia.js Features: List and explain the key features of Inertia.js, including its role in data-driven UI,
        client-side routing, and shared controllers. Provide practical examples to illustrate these features.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Integration with Laravel: If possible, set up a basic project using Laravel and Inertia.js to create a simple
        web application. Create at least one page with Inertia.js, and explain how Inertia.js is used within the Laravel
        framework.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Client-Side Components: Discuss the usage of a frontend framework Vue.js alongside Inertia.js to create
        client-side components. Explain how data is exchanged between the server and client.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note: For learners unfamiliar with PHP, it is not necessary to implement the Laravel and Inertia.js project
        (step 4) if they have no prior experience with PHP. Instead, they can focus on the theoretical understanding of
        Inertia.js and its concepts.
        <br>
        <br>
        Submission:
        <br>
        <br>
        Compile your research, findings, and any code examples into a well-organised document. Ensure that your essay is
        well-structured and provides clear explanations. Submit your assignment in the preferred format and share the
        GitHub repository link.
